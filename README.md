"A Novel Application of Machine Learning Algorithms on Toxin Proteins to Predict Molecular Function"
This project was originally developed by Praneeth Muvva and Ameya Kulkarni. We were honored to be 2023 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Finalists in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics for our work.

Venom peptides and proteins can disrupt key biological processes and have pharmaceutical potential. However, many toxin proteins lack functional annotation. We used machine learning, specifically a neural network trained on amino acid sequence and structural data, to classify 86 toxin molecular functions with 95.59% accuracy. This approach can accelerate drug discovery from venoms.

This repository is a work in progress, aiming to provide broader access to our research product. The current additions and ongoing development are solely by Praneeth Muvva.
